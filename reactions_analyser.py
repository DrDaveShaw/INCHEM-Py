    Parameters
    ----------
    output_folder : string
        The name of the folder to save the csv of reaction rates to.
    out_directory : string
        The name of the folder created by INCHEM-Py when running the model
        that contains the outputs from the model.
    species : string
        Name of the species for which reaction rates should be calculated in
        MCM format.
    master_array : dict
        dictionary of arrays of reactions that can be reduced
        to form the system of ODEs to be solved within INCHEM-Py.
    reactions : dict
        the unpickled reaction rate coefficients.
    out_data : dict
        the unpickled species concentration with time created by INCHEM-Py.
    time_index : float
        Time of simulation, in seconds, for which to calculate the reaction
        rates. Must be divisible by dt from the INCHEM-Py simulation.
    surface_dict_path : string
        File path to the surface dictionary used for the simulation being analysed.
        Can be absolute or ralative to this file.
    timed_emissions : boolean
        Are timed emissions being used?
    timed_inputs : dict
        Timed emissions from the settings.py file of the simulation being analysed.
    H2O2_dep : boolean
        Are H2O2 deposition reactions being used?
    O3_dep : boolean
        Are O3 deposition reactions being used?

    Returns
    -------
    df : pandas dataframe
        dataframe containing the actual rates of production or loss rate of a 
        species due to a specific reaction. Is exported to a csv.
    spec_calc : dict
        Full rates of reaction for each species in the master array at time_index.
